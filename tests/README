Test files must be checked out on an external SVN, with the revision given by the "files-svn-rev" file.
Your usual picviz developer credentials must be used.

To get these files, you can do, in the picviz-inspector/tests directory :

$ svn co https://svn.srv.picviz/tests-files@$(cat files-svn-rev) files
