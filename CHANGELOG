   duplicate, so that different processing can be applied

This minor release fixes:

 * invalid values for the frequency gradient in some rare cases some arguments
 * weren't updated when using a filter selection ivnertion works after a filter
 * has been applied invalid lines were displayed in some rare cases in the
 * zoomed parallel views

3.0 "Retribution" (2012-11-12)
------------------------------

This major release add the following features:

 * Complete rewrite of the underlying graphic engines
    - improved rendering speed
    - customisable rendering backends
    - multiple graphic cards support

 * Improved data storage,
    - increased number of supported events
    - enhanced hardware efficiency

 * Improved user interface
    - improved zoom mode
    - new selection mode using sliders
    - dockable windows for every type of data representation, making the correlation between multiple sources of data easier
    - increased interface responsiveness
    - data representations implemented as plugins allowing easier application extension

 * Export display compliance

2.6.1 (2012-07-31)
------------------

This minor release fixes:
 * invalid characters displayed with empty fields given by the URL splitter
 * various bug in the format builder (espacially within the regular expression helper)


2.6 "Carlsberg" (2012-07-24)
----------------------------

New features:

 * correlation between different sources

Improvements:
 * new parser for the URL splitter, giving two more fields: anchor and credentials
 * better size handling for the font of the parallel view axes name.
 * optimisations related to selections processing

Bug fixes:
 * URL splitter giving strange values for the 'port' and 'variable' fields
 * Format builder creating invalid parameter for the "filter" plugin

2.5 "Dean" (2012-04-11)
-----------------------

New features:

 * presets for filters
 * display invalid elements that have been discovered during the extraction on user demand
 * split subdomains in the url splitter
 * add a new entropy filter to search for Shannon entropy a given string

Improvements:
 * improvements in OpenGL memory management that allows 40 millions lines maximum

Bug fixes:
 * plotting mode "logarithmic min/max" was in some cases not distributed.
Moreover, expanding a selection on a axis using the logarithmic mode gave
wrong results.
 * various bugs in the format builder
 * race condition that involved a random crash when loading one or more files
 * closing Picviz Inspector when some views are opened do not longer cause the
application to freeze

2.4.1 (2012-02-14) - Valentine's day release :)
------------------

This minor release fixes:
 * de-synchronization of the listing and the GL views after an extraction
 * show column names even when no lines are selected

This minor release adds the features:
 * show the number of invalid elements during an extraction

2.4 (2012-01-23)
----------------

New features:
 * sorting plugins allow columns to be sorted according to their types
 * list unique values of a column (for a given selection)
 * ability to set the current selection as the selection of a given layer
 * ability to directly modify, in the mapping/plotting edit dialog, the parameters of a type (like the time format)

New filters:
 * multiple and selection-based search
 * create layers based on regular expressions

Improvements:
 * improve interface design
 * really reduce the overall amount of RAM usage
 * set the number of maximum lines to 15 millions
 * improve listing sorting and displaying performances
 * improve visualisation performance by caching some intensive computations
 * improve lines drawing performances
 * performance improvements of the search filters
 * performance improvements of some core algorithms

Bug fixes :
 * fix crashes due to bad listing synchronisation with the OpenGL views
 * do not crash when an invalid mapping and/or plotting is used in a format
 * fix bug in the URL splitter that could cause a crash with some inputs

Known issues :
 * if you have this error message when starting the application:

  Could not find platform independent libraries <prefix>
  Could not find platform dependent libraries <exec_prefix>
  Consider setting $PYTHONHOME to <prefix>[:<exec_prefix>]
  Fatal Python error: Py_Initialize: Unable to get the locale encoding
  LookupError: no codec search functions registered: can't find encoding

 it means that the incorporated python interpreter couldn't find a python installation.
 This is currently used by the "Snort for logs" plugin.
 A solution is to install the "python3.2" debian package. A workaround is to remove
 the file layer-filters/liblayer_snort_for_logs.so .
