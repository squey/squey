/*! \brief Template class that defines an interactor for a PVGraphicsView-based class.
 *
 * This class defines an interactor for a PVGraphicsView-based class. Thus, T must be a subclass of
 *PVGraphicsView.
 * It is recommanded to set a public typedef for any PVGraphicsView-based class, so that it is
 *easier to create a new interactor for that type of view.
 *
 * For instance, in the parallel view library, this typedef is defined in
 *PVZoomableDrawingAreaInteractor.h:
 *
 * \code
 * typedef PVWidgets::PVGraphicsViewInteractor<PVZoomableDrawingArea>
 *PVZoomableDrawingAreaInteractor;
 * \endcode
