 *
 * This class computes "in live" a mean value of values added one by one. It does not
 * store all the values but only their sum. It could compute the mean value each time and only
 * save this mean value and the number of values, but it would involve a loss of precision.
 * So, Tsum can be different that T because, for instance, T can be int16_t but the sum would be
 *int64_t.
 *
 * This a template class and each lib will include its versions. There is *no* need for
