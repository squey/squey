/*! \brief Defines a "slice" of an existing buffer. Used by the normalisation process.
 *
 * This class originally defines a slice of an existing buffer. It is the base class of \ref
 *PVCore::PVElement
 * and \ref PVCore::PVField. A slice can be "detached" from the original buffer if a reallocation is
 *done. If such
 * reallocation occurs, the new pointer is add to a list of buffers, sothat further deallocation can
 *be done.
 * For now, a \ref PVCore::PVElement object contains a list of buffers reallocated by its fields.
 *
 * \remark
 * A buffer slice has two sizes: a logical and a physical one. The logical size is changed according
 *to \ref set_end, and
 * is the size of useful data inside this slice. The pysical size is the size to which a slice can
 *grow without the need
 * of any reallocations.
